          <u>Laboratory Membership</u></br>
          Member of the traffic fluid project, an European research council advanced grant 
          <a href="https://www.trafficfluid.tuc.gr/en/home">
            (LINK)
          </a>. 
          Worked as a diploma-thesis student member in the project
          <a href="https://www.trafficfluid.tuc.gr/en/people/diploma-thesis-students">(LINK)
            
          </a>, from the July 2021 until the September of 2022. Involved in the research 
          and the development process of related tasks to the area of
          autonomous driving in lane-free traffic settings. Contributions include the calculation of the artificial potential fields about 
          the probability of crashing between vehicles in a lane-free vehicular road and the development of popular learning algorithms, like
          q-learning, to the 
          aforementioned paradigm. Implemented the diploma thesis as part of this project. (Details below and in <a href="Projects.html">Portfolio</a>).

            <u>Bachelor Degree Thesis</u></br> 
            <b>Title</b>: Monte Carlo tree search for autonomous driving in lane-free traffic settings.</br>
            The project was a part of the traffic fluid project. It involved the use of the Monte Carklo Tree Search algorithm (MCTS) in 
           the domain of lane-free autonomous driving.
